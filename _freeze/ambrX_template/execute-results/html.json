Edit the title and author above, following the format of the other sessions.\n2.  Do any necessary data preprocessing in the housekeeping chunk below (and leave this in the script).\n3.  Try to stick to this main structure unless you have reason not to. Include the intro and learning objectives, Parts A-C (including a break), summary sections, and link to provide feedback. There are horizontal line breaks between each one.\n4.  Note that the headings will be numbered once rendered - using heading level 2 for each major step of the analysis in the worked example, and lower heading levels as appropriate.\n5.  Code solutions should be included, but hidden. There's an example set-up for a hidden code chunk below, as well as a \"hint\" option.\n6.  The visual formatting is controlled across all pages via the separate \\_quarto.yml file. This is also what we edit to add the page link to the menu (so we can hopefully test out the upload before students can readily find the page). If you have trouble with github, you can just send me this file instead.\n:::\n\n\n\n# Introduction\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Learning objectives\"}\nAs a reminder, the learning objectives for this week are:\n\n1.  \n\n2.  \n\n3.  \n\n4.  \n\n5.  \n:::\n\n*\\[Introductory text\\]*\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Setting up\n\n## Packages\n\nToday's practical will use the following packages.

Please take a moment to rate the difficulty and length of these practical activities via [this survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSepox6r76dAkSDZRxybJwCvRX28M7BS1_81fGMybkqsvBPvRA/viewform?usp=publish-editor), and let us know of any issues you encountered or aspects you didn't understand (positive feedback is also welcome!). You will need to be logged in with your university account to respond, but your submission will be anonymous.\n\nFor more general questions about the practical, please post them on the [VLE Discussion Board](https://vle.york.ac.uk/ultra/courses/_116420_1/engagement/discussion/_6408724_1?view=discussions&disGroupId=default&courseId=_116420_1).\n:::\n",
