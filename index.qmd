# Welcome

Welcome to *Advanced Methods in Behavioural Research!*

Each week's lecture content is available via the [VLE module page](https://vle.york.ac.uk/ultra/courses/_116420_1/outline). These course pages are where you will find the materials for the practical sessions. Each practical session will have its own page of instructions released throughout the semester. Instructions can also be downloaded in Word/PDF format should you prefer.

This page outlines how each practical session is set up. Before you begin in Week 1, you should also check out the [guidelines](ambr0_guide.qmd) for setting up your workspace for this module.

# Practical format

We have a two-hour practical timetabled each week (11am-1pm Fridays, PS/A/203). Each session has tasks for you to complete independently, with the session lead available to support and answer questions throughout.

## Preparation

We expect that you will come to this session having attended the lecture on Monday, or caught up via the recording if you were unable to make it in person. We also expect that you will have done (at least) the core reading for the week to consolidate your understanding. Having done so will help you to engage fully with the practical session, and also enable you to ask questions about aspects that you did not understand.

## Part A: Core example

This first part of the practical will provide detailed instructions on how to conduct the relevant analysis steps.

-   Work through the instructions to run the analysis yourself, checking your understanding and taking notes as you go.
-   Where available/appropriate, this section may make use of built-in datasets from R or the relevant packages. This isn't us being lazy, it's for very good reasons!
    -   First, these datasets are frequently used in tutorials and help files, meaning that building your familiarity with them will make it easier to understand online resources as you develop your understanding further.
    -   Second, being able to use these datasets is a core part of being able to ask for help. Posting in online forums requires that you [create a reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) of your issue - i.e., code that allows someone else to recreate the issue that you are experiencing. This is much easier if you can call upon an existing dataset that others can access too.
-   Where we have hidden code sections, do your best to try and figure out the solution yourself before peeking! Trial and error is a much more effective way of learning, and will help you to build your coding skills.
-   This section is the minimum amount that you are expected to work through within the session.

## Part B: Application

The second section will instruct you to apply the analysis steps to a new question and/or dataset. This is designed to stretch your ability, and you may encounter some challenges along the way! If you don't finish this within the practical session itself, you may want to continue this at home. You can ask any outstanding questions on the VLE.

## Part C: Challenge yourself!

If you have completed both of the above, this last section encourages you to have a go at figuring something out for yourself.

# Resolving issues

As you will already have learned, you can count on getting stuck at various points during the practical sessions. Errors are a very normal part of coding, even if sometimes frustrating! If you get stuck, try the following:

1.  Spend time trying some different things! What's happening that you don't expect? Is there an error message, and does it tell you anything useful?
2.  Google it! Copying and pasting the error message into Google often takes you to help forums where others have asked about the same problem.
3.  Chat to the person next to you—maybe they can spot something in your code that you can't see?
4.  Ask the session lead, we're here to help!

# Feeding back

These practical sessions have been developed this year for your cohort. There is a link to a very brief survey at the end of each practical—please use it each week to tell us how you're getting on! It will take \<30 seconds to let us know whether the amount and difficulty of the content was suitable, and there's an open text box if you would like to any further comments beyond this. Thank you!
