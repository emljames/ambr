We will run an analysis to assess evidence in favour of the “Red-Romance Hypothesis” (Elliot & Niesta, 2008): a theory grounded in evolutionary and cultural psychology that the colour red enhances perceptions of attractiveness. The dataset was curated by Lehmann et al (2018), and released through the metadat package that we have loaded above.\nStart by loading it into your environment. Inspect the dataframe that you have loaded, and use the help files to understand the variables.\n\n# Load  metadat dataset into environment \nrr_dat &lt;- dat.lehmann2018\n\n# Inspect dataset information\nhelp(dat.lehmann2018)\n\nYou should be able to see that the dataset consists of a single effect size (yi) per row, with various other columns to code information about the study it was collected from.\nLet’s explore some data characteristics:\n\nUse nrow() to count the number of effect sizes (rows) in the dataset.\nYou can count the number of different studies using length(unique(rr_dat$Full_Citation).\nUse the range() or min()/max() functions to assess the range of sample sizes (Total.SampleSize) in the studies.\nCount the number of studies with male versus female participants using table(rr_dat$Gender).\nHow many studies were preregistered?

Let’s start by focusing on ‘males rating females’. Filter the dataset accordingly, and then use the forest() function to plot the effect sizes.\n\n# Select only effect sizes corresponding to male participants\nrr_m_ppts &lt;- filter(rr_dat, Gender == \"Males\")\n\n# Plot \nforest(rr_m_ppts$yi, rr_m_ppts$vi, slab = rr_m_ppts$Short_Title)\n\nWe have provided the forest() function with the list of standardised effect sizes, sampling variances, and list of study labels.

    "section": "3.2 Computing pooled effect sizes",
    "text": "3.2 Computing pooled effect sizes\nIn the lecture, you learned about fixed and random effects meta-analyses. Let’s have a go at running both.\n\n3.2.1 Fixed effects meta-analysis\nIn a fixed effects analysis, we assume that all studies are measuring the same underlying true effect size, and calculate the average effect size across the included studies. The metafor package terms this an “equal effects” model, as a better descriptive name. Use the rma() function to run this as follows:\n\n# Fixed effects model \nrr_fixed_m &lt;- rma(yi = yi, vi = vi,                  \n                 method = \"FE\", data = rr_m_ppts) \n\nWe’ve specified the variables with our effect size estimates and sampling variance, which have conveniently been named the same already by the authors. We’ve then specified the “FE” method for fixed effects, and the dataset to use.\nWe can use the summary() function on the model object to inspect the results.\n\nsummary(rr_fixed_m)\n\nThe output tells us that we ran a Fixed-Effects model with k = 45 effect sizes. The pooled estimate for the standardised mean difference is ~0.15, showing a small but significant effect of the colour red on men’s attractiveness ratings of women. However, it also tells us that there is substantial heterogeneity in study outcomes, indicating that the studies might be capturing varied effect sizes due to potential moderators or different study designs.\n\n\n3.2.2 Random effects meta-analysis\nThe heterogeneity indicates that a random effects model might be more appropriate— i.e., one that assumes that the samples in the meta-analysis are a random sample from a larger population of studies that could plausibly have been/will be conducted. This makes sense when we consider the study descriptions: they use a range of different outcome measures, and often include methodological variation within the same publications (as described in the study titles).\nWe can run this by simply changing the method in the meta-analysis function. The package provides us with several different options that have different ways of estimating the heterogeneity between studies (feel free to read more about these!), but for now we will stick with the default option.\n\n# Random effects model \nrr_random_m &lt;- rma(yi = yi, vi = vi,                 \n                  method = \"REML\", data = rr_m_ppts) \n\nUse the summary() function as above to inspect the model output. How has the pooled estimate for the standardised mean difference changed?\nWe can also inspect the results by including the pooled estimates on our forest plot. The forest() function can also take the meta-analysis model objects directly (rather than the separate lists of effect sizes and variances). Try this now with each of your models.\n\n\nShow the code\nforest(rr_fixed_m, slab = rr_m_ppts$Short_Title)\nforest(rr_random_m, slab = rr_m_ppts$Short_Title)"

    "section": "3.3 Weighting studies",
    "text": "3.3 Weighting studies\nWe saw when we loaded the dataset that the variation in sample size was very large. We should consider this in our analysis: a very large study likely provides a better estimate of the true effect size than a very small study.\n\n3.3.1 Under the hood: inverse variance\nOne of the most common ways to do this is via inverse-variance, which the rma() function does by default. If you inspect your rr_m_pptsdata frame, you will see that the smaller samples generally have the highest variance (vi). You might be able to see this more clearly via a quick scatterplot:\n\n# Inspect relationship between \nplot(rr_m_ppts$Total.SampleSize, rr_m_ppts$vi)\n\n# Now plot inverse variance instead\nplot(rr_m_ppts$Total.SampleSize, 1/rr_m_ppts$vi)\n\nTo use this variance in the analysis, the model uses the inverse (1/variance), so that smaller samples have the smallest weighting. The function does this under the hood, but you can see what this looks like by computing it for yourself. Recreate your plot using 1/rr_m_ppts$vi as your y variable.\nYou should now see a steady positive trend for the majority of studies, with higher inverse variance for large studies. A few studies buck this trend, with little variance in their estimates despite small-medium sample sizes. Can you identify them in the dataset?\n\n\n3.3.2 Changing weights in the meta-analysis\nBecause weighting by inverse variance is a very common and sensible approach, the rma() meta-analysis function does this by default. This means you’ve already weighted your samples in your above models!\nTo compare, try fitting two new models (fixed, random) and include the argument weighted = FALSE. Use a different object name to store the model output, so that you can inspect the differences in output when you call summary().\nAlternatively, you can try weighting by sample size alone, by setting weights = N."

    "text": "4.1 Introduction to the dataset\nLet’s jump in with a new dataset! This time we will use a recently published meta-analysis that examined the relationship between procedural learning and reading ability (Oliveira et al., 2023).\nThe Procedural Deficit Hypothesis proposes that reading and language disorders stem from a difficulty in the procedural learning system - i.e., the system that underpins the learning of probabilistic knowledge (Ullman et al., 2020). Procedural learning has often been measured using Serial Reaction Time (SRT) tasks: participants respond to a repeating sequence of stimuli, and their improvements in speed over several blocks are measured as an index of learning. However, evidence that SRT performance is associated with reading ability is mixed, with some studies showing a strong association and others finding nothing at all. Many studies in this area suffer from small sample sizes, making it hard to draw sound conclusions.\nThis meta-analysis was conducted by a former PhD student at York, Dr Catia Oliveira, together with Professor Lisa Henderson and Dr Emma Hayiou-Thomas. We will walk through one new step of the process together in extracting effect sizes and calculating pooled variances. Then you will apply your new meta-analysis skills."

    "text": "6.1 Recap\nThis week, we’ve seen how meta-analyses can be used to synthesise evidence across a range of different studies to answer a research question. The starting point of any meta-analysis is a systematic literature search—although this would have been far too large a task for today’s practical! From there, we’ve learned to extract effect sizes, calculate sampling variances, and pool them according to principled decisions about how they should be weighted and combined in the model. We saw how to inspect for possible publication bias, and create gold-standard visualisations of the results. Well done!\nWe ran a basic version of these models here, but there is much more you can do to correct for small sample sizes and adjust for the fact that some estimates come from the same study (i.e., there were different correlation coefficients for different measures of reading in the same sample). If you are interested in these issues, you can access the full paper here or download the full dataset and analysis scripts."

This isn’t us being lazy, it’s for very good reasons!\n\nFirst, these datasets are frequently used in tutorials and help files, meaning that building your familiarity with them will make it easier to understand online resources as you develop your understanding further.\nSecond, being able to use these datasets is a core part of being able to ask for help. Posting in online forums requires that you create a reproducible example of your issue - i.e., code that allows someone else to recreate the issue that you are experiencing. This is much easier if you can call upon an existing dataset that others can access too.\n\nWhere we have hidden code sections, do your best to try and figure out the solution yourself before peeking! Trial and error is a much more effective way of learning, and will help you to build your coding skills.\nThis section is the minimum amount that you are expected to work through within the session."
